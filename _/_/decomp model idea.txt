Model Idea: Receptive Field Driven Model of Pattern Transfer



Start with a receptive field layer on a given problem; then, 1-to-1 connections between receptive nodes and second layer of hidden nodes (ie, each hidden node gets it's own trainable receptive field)

Then, on new problems, retrain the receptive nodes but dont retrain the hidden nodes <-- see if they can detect the same patterns in new regions of space
